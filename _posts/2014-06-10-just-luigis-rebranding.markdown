Look, this is a business my mom owns. When I saw her business cards that she had designed herself, I just couldn't help but step in, even though I rarely have good experiences working for friends or family. It just gets weird trying to figure out either just compensation for time or doing work at a deep discount while still being as available as they expect.

Somehow, they managed to pair Papyrus and Comic Sans to unintentionally create a meme of bad design, and then topped it off with a menacing hillbilly in a wifebeater that you may or may not need to hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife from, paired with a red and black color scheme to warn any potential attackers that it is, in fact, poisonous and deadly.

Exactly what you want to communicate as a family-friendly, N.Y. style pizza joint.

Their makeshift website wasn't much better.

The first thing I pitched to them was a consistent branding. Since my mom is a new small business owner with little interest or awareness of marketing concepts, I explained that this meant a logo mark and typography that remained consistent across business cards, menus, building valances, window decals, websites, flyers, postcards, shirts... just about anything imaginable.

I started with paring down any of this stuff to the base essence of who they were: a classic, authentic pizzeria in an old-timey neighborhood.

The design aesthetic I wanted to convey was centered around these concepts: Italian, New York, Pizza, Retro, Clean. Here's the pitch:

I took a look at their mobile traffic from Yelp Business and realized that they had a good number of visitors monthly coming to their site from mobile devices after viewing the Yelp reviews page for their business. In thinking about a user on the go, perhaps looking for a potential lunch spot, I assessed that the main components that needed to be easily accessible were a tap-to-call phone number, address linked to a map, menu, and hours open.

jQuery Mobile fit the bill for a quick and dirty "m-dot" site rollout, while the desktop site seemed fine to leave as a rebranded landing page with a link to download the most current printable menu .pdf.
