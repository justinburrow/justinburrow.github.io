Soapbox alert.

You're sitting in a scrum. You talk about a one-off project that references things outside the normal scope of day-to-day operations. Someone asks you, "What's that?"

There's only one wrong answer to that question.

"I don't know."

<!--break-->

Granted, when we're executing, the ticket is the brief and sometimes that's all we have to go off of. We can do our best to make assumptions about what's needed based on historical evidence from other similar projects, but this is just educated guessing, and that's hardly a strategy for efficiency.

Picking up a tool to start working without the who, what, when, where and why sorted out is a really quick way to deliver mediocre work at best, or at worst, completely miss the mark.

From my experience, it's easy to fall into a mistaken belief that asking questions to gain context is a nuisance or wasting other people's time, but I can't logically think of a scenario where the business wouldn't want you to have any and all details pertinent to a project so the end result can be the best possible deliverable.

Ask questions. Make sure you've got the context, understand the audience, and grasp the intended outcome, and _then_ start working. You'll have an answer at the ready for any discussion about your approach and the logic behind it.
