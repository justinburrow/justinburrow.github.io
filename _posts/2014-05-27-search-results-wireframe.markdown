One of the big projects last year was to add an entirely different product line to our catalog, and revamp the site to accommodate these new products. The rollout was to be done in phases - phase one was a shoehorning/bolt-on to our existing site, with phase two slated to be an entire redesign with mobile/responsive considerations.

Search results got a little messy because these new products had an entirely different schema and filtering requirement than our existing product line. The product results returned to a customer went from one-to-one to shop-by-browsing, so it was a little bit of an exercise to retain a familiar experience while also alloting for new functionality.

This was the preliminary wireframe for the bolted-on search results. We added support for left-hand filtering, as well as a consideration to entirely remove the new product line results from the list for customers who were only interested in the products they had been purchasing from us previously. A big business objective was to ensure that we weren't cannibalizing existing sales for the sake of adding in new SKUs.
