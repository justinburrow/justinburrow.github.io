Sometimes I plunk through different sound libraries that I have, looking for something inspiring - some new sound I haven't really worked with before.  There's times, though, when even this approach is exhausted, and I'm stuck looking for new ways to make interesting sounds.  Right around the time that I wrote the track for this song, I started forcing myself to create audio chains in traditionally "wrong" ways - compressors after reverbs, putting mastering tape effects as an insert, etc.  I started to arbitrarily pull up software instrument tracks and begin stacking various effects as inserts without previewing what they were doing first, and then blindly checking to see what kind of mess I created.

I don't even remember what the base patch was that I started with, but it was something like a vintage synth doing an impression of a Rhodes electric piano.  I do remember putting some effects on it to give it a grimier tonality, and this riff just sort of happened while I was playing these really wide 10th intervals.

Serendipitously, I had just gotten ahold of a sample pack of stomps and claps that I really wanted to use on something, so I sketched out a quick stomp/clap loop underneath this idea.

Kotomi immediately had melodies for this, and penned some lyrics to fit.

The song was 90% finished in one day of tracking vocals and guitars on top of everything, with the only additional tracking being some drum overdubs.
