###Web Development
When I was in middle school, I had a friend named Matt that arrived at school one morning, proudly proclaiming that he could build a web page.  It was about 1997, and my Macintosh Performa 450 had just enough hard drive space remaining on its 100MB drive to install Netscape.  He got my competitive side engaged and we both spent hours at home reading "HTML for Dummies"-type books until we could hand-write our own markup proficiently.  I made a bunch of "sites", featuring copy/pasted content from other sites about my favorite bands, and hosted them on Angelfire or Geocities.  Framesets were the jam.

In high school, I had another friend show me a "site" he built which featured a heavily-textured UI, delicately sliced-up using a table layout.  It was absolutely mind-blowing.  Months were spent combing through Photoshop tutorials to learn how to create realistic, skeumorphic textures to apply to interfaces.

Then came Flash.  :::shudder:::

It wasn't until XHTML/CSS2 became prevalent that I started to really take an interest in design for the web.  I ditched Dreamweaver for Coda and prided myself on writing bulletproof stylesheets that could stand up to whatever IE compatibility issues arose.

Spending a number of years in the eCommerce space congealed my focus into a blend of UX and front end development.  Getting my feet wet with the Magento platform gave me a lot of insight into the complexities of eCommerce CMS platforms, and that's where I've primarily operated from for the past five years.

###Music
I kind of figured out how to read sheet music from my uncle's abandoned piano books that he left inside the piano bench at my grandmother's house when I was pretty little.  Playing classical piano bored me to death so I pestered my parents for a guitar when I was 10.  A loaned four-track tape machine got me started in the world of multi-track recording, followed by the temporary housing of a neighbor's full MIDI studio.  I learned to step-sequence on a Roland MC500 with MKII software.

My twenties were spent doing recording sessions and live gigs with local bands, until I got a little exhausted from burning the candle at both ends between these gigs and my day job.  These days, I co-write with Kotomi and produce/engineer a good portion of it out of my apartment in Long Beach, CA.
