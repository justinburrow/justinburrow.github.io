Four years ago, when I started in my current position, I had the typical **Web Designer** skillset. Hand-coded XHTML, CSS, and a little experience with jQuery and PHP-via-Wordpress. That was well suited for a web design job in the eCommerce space. Coding up emails with tables, making basic static sites and landing pages, and generating front-end markup and CSS to deliver to the dev team to get implemented into the platform we were running at the time.

Meanwhile...

The industry moved on.

jQuery got really prevalent.

People really got into optimizing the mobile experience.

Responsive design hit the scene.

These really smart guys came out with Node.js, and a slew of other Javascript frameworks started peppering the text of the web design related blogs I followed.

Grunt. SASS/Less. Yeoman. Angular.js. Modernizr. Selectivizr. Backbone. Ditching Photoshop. Designing-in-Browser. Static site generators.

All of these things were useful, new technologies that front end guys were starting to utilize, become comfortable with, and put to work to make really great products.

Back at work, I was still trying to force Wordpress to act like a good CMS for a company intranet, and recreating a Facebook-like function with SQL table writes.

Sometimes, every few months or so, I'd take a night fueled by copious amounts of caffeine, and really try to wrap my head around just one of these new technologies.

I'd get a little way into it, excitement would ensue, and then the day-to-day grind of simple HTML work would start to edge out the memory of how any of that stuff worked.

And that's what often happens in the corporate space. Every job I've held in-house has been problematic in this way.

These days, I think it would be very difficult for anyone with the skillset I had four years ago to get anything other than a really junior-level position. While many companies still operate under this schema, I don't think it's true that there are many of them that are hiring to perpetuate that model.

Technology, in general, has proven to evolve on a bell curve. It doesn't progress in a linear fashion. Web-related technologies are no different. Things are moving **FAST**.

I'm of the persuasion that to be really good and capable in this field, it's more than a full-time job. It requires going home and building things. Being in community with people who are also involved in similar work. Making stuff just to make it. Breaking things and putting them back together. I don't believe you can really do enough of this, especially if you work in an environment that's a little stagnated.

One of the initiatives I'm attempting to pioneer is an extracurricular build-sesh, involving anyone from our Design and Dev teams that want to pod-up together and build something just to build it - on the weekends, after hours, on lunch... whatever. The benefits here seem obvious - skills remain sharp, teamwork is encouraged, the company at large gets visibility into how capable and talented its employees are outside of the general grind, and perhaps upper management starts to become motivated to evolve, iterate, and erase any complacency towards stagnation.

In a perfect world, anyway.

If you find yourself in a position like I've described, realize that things are evolving around you and past you. Get current and passionate in one small facet, and let that drive you to embrace the newer utilties available to help you, in the end, create a better product.
