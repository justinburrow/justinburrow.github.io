Last year, we wanted to get on board with the **Movember** movement and deliver a kitschy email campaign that would let us use our brand to push awareness. "Movember" is trademarked against commercial use, so we opted for **"No-Shave November"**.

I had the idea to create an animated .gif of beards growing in a looping format for the hero image. For four weeks, I shot pictures of employees twice a week, then edited and compiled them down into the hero image below. In addition, I played a large role in the art direction of the visual tone for the email campaign by setting the typography and texture before the rest of the email was designed around this.
