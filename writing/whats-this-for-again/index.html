	  <h2 class="post-title">The Copycat Fallacy</h2>

	  <p class="post-meta">posted Sep 2, 2014 in Design</p>

	  <article class="post-content">
	    <p>It makes sense - if it worked before, why reinvent the wheel? In a lot of ways, this is true, and works well. The eCommerce space is a great arena to put this idea into practice. I frequently begin wireframing site functionality by examining what Amazon, Target, or Walmart does, and then contrast that against more modern online retailers like Shoplet or Poppin. These behemoth companies have teams of people that I naturally assume have vetted out these concepts to a degree that’s just not available to me at a smaller organization.</p>

<p>The downfall here is in getting into a habit of not thinking.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Sometimes, what worked for the obvious role models doesn’t work well for your product, your customer base, or your site platform.</p>

<p>It can become an insidious company culture cancer that encourages unoriginality without employing consideration and common sense. “It’s this way because that’s how Company X does it” becomes a silver bullet argument hardly anyone will be willing to stand up against.</p>

<p>From a high level perspective, borrowing ideas from companies larger than yours can be a great source of inspiration and direction, but should always be carefully weighed out against business needs, objectives and the target audience.</p>

<p>On a low level, internal copycat-ism can be even more problematic.</p>

<p>Today, I saw a comp for a site feature that had some pretty strange verbiage, and had copy giving helpful tips for one function sitting next to a completely unrelated function.</p>

<p>When I asked the designer if this copy was provided by somebody or if we had just rolled with it as placeholder, the answer I got back was: “That’s how it was on the comp for one of our other sites.”</p>

<p>For whatever merit lies in referencing the strategy and brainstorming of a company with bigger resources, ripping your own ideas off has considerably less than that.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no matter what was done before internally, or what someone else has done elsewhere that is similar to the project being worked on, conscious thought must come into play in every step of the process. Asking, “Does this make sense?” needs to be an intuitive response as each piece of the puzzle settles into place, and before the deliverables are shipped, a final once-over from a customer’s perspective has to happen in order to ensure that nothing was designed in a vacuum, by designers, for designers.</p>
